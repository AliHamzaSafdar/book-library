# Book Store Apis<br>

# Project Overview:

The goal of this project was to create a robust RESTful API for an online bookstore using Python, Django, Django REST framework, and Celery. The API encompasses the following features:<br>

# 1. User Registration and Authentication:<br>

 - Implemented user registration, login, and logout functionalities.<br>
 - Secured API endpoints with Token Authentication to protect user data.<br>

# 2. CRUD Operations:<br>
* **Books**: Created, read, updated, and deleted books with attributes such as title, author, published date, ISBN, and category.<br>
* **Authors**: Managed CRUD operations for authors.<br>
* **Categories**: Handled CRUD operations for book categories.<br>

# 3. Shopping Cart:<br>

 - Implemented shopping cart functionalities, including adding books, viewing cart contents, removing books, and purchasing books in the cart.

# 4. Email Notifications:<br>

* Utilized Celery for background tasks to send email notifications to users after successful purchase of books in their cart.<br>

# Implementation Details:<br>

* Python and Django were used to build the backend of the application.<br>
* Django REST Framework was employed to create the API, making it easy to design and document the endpoints.<br>
* A PostgreSQL database was chosen to store all the necessary data securely.<br>
* Extensive unit tests were written to ensure the reliability of API endpoints.<br>
* Docker was used for containerization, making it straightforward to set up and run the application in different environments.<br>
* GitHub Actions were configured for Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD), allowing for automated testing and deployment.<br>

# Prerequisites:<br>
